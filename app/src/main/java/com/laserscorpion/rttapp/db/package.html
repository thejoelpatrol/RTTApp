The database layer handles saving persistent data in a SQLiteDatabase.
<p>
    Each table is specified in TextAppContract, and a helper class is available for inserting and
    retrieving data from each table.
</p>
<p>
    As of now, only one table exists, for saved conversations. It may be useful in the future to
    save records of all calls, whether they resulted in saved text or not (e.g. missed calls,
    attempted calls, etc). This should have its own helper class, following the pattern of
    ConversationHelper, as should any future tables.
