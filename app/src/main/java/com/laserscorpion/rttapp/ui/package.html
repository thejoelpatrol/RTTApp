The UI layer is the part the user sees and touches, the 5 different screens that each manage a
different part of the registration/call process.

<p>When opening the app, the first Activity run is FirstActivity, though
it may or may not actually be visible, and may immediately launch the next one,
RTTRegistrationActivity. The app stays there until the user either calls someone or receives a call.
An incoming call launches IncomingCallActivity (this can happen when the app is not even in focus,
or the phone is locked). The call itself takes place inside RTTCallActivity.

<p>Errors and some other required interactions are displayed in several kinds of Dialogs (modal pop-up
windows).
