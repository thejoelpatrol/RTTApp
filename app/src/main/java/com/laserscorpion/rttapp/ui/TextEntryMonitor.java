/**
 * <p>The TextEntryMonitor, one of which is created by the RTTCallActivity at a time,
 * listens for input on the user's text field (EditText), and keeps track of which
 * characters have changed. It sends those characters in the real-time call via the SipClient.</p>
 *
 * <p>There are two modes, real time and en bloc, specified in the constructor.</p>
 *
 * <p>Real-time mode:<br>
 * If text is added or deleted at the end, TextEntryMonitor tells the SipClient to send
 * the new characters (possibly '\b') in the real-time call. If edits are made earlier in the text,
 * it undoes them, since the user is not allowed to add or remove text anywhere besides the
 * end of the field. Keeping track of these edits is pretty annoying, and you need to understand how
 * the Android.text.TextWatcher interface works before touching any of this.</p>
 *
 * <p>En bloc mode:<br>
 * Text is not sent character by character. It is only sent as complete messages, when checkAndSend()
 * is called.</p>

     * made by this code, not by the user. Thus we have the flag makingManualEdit, which is set in
     * afterTextChanged(), if it sees the flag needManualEdit.
