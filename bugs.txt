bugs

-sometimes registering freezes at a black screen
	-this doesn't seem to happen any more…?
-sometimes that JAIN SIP asynctask race condition is triggered in responding to OPTIONS 
	- but who really cares?
-excess BYEs seem to be sent by the server, but they don’t seem to cause any problems
-messed up lock handling for setting up new calls
-need to re-register after expiration
-probably don't need to wait on get() any more
-non-printing characters are not received correctly (esp delete!)
-@todo Backspace handling in sending messages
-shouldn't allow edits to previous text
-doze/standby (this is a way future problem)

UI deficiencies
-so ugly
-report errors via dialogs
-log in RegistrationActivity is probably not useful
-entire RegistrationActivity should be replaced with phone book or recent calls or something
-need to display "from" on incoming call activity
-app only works in foreground, in RegistrationActivity. should fire an Intent when it's running in bg
