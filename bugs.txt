bugs

-sometimes registering freezes at a black screen
-sometimes that JAIN SIP asynctask race condition is triggered in responding to OPTIONS - but who really cares?
-excess BYEs seem to be sent by the server, but they donâ€™t seem to cause any problems
-messed up lock handling for setting up new calls
-need to re-register after expiration
-preferences activity display is messed up
-need to display "from" on incoming call activity
-probably don't need to wait on get() any more
-non-printing characters are not received correctly (esp delete!)
-@todo Backspace handling in sending messages
